# PopularMovies

## Project Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, an app is built to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

## This app:

 - Presents the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
 - Allows user to change sort order via a setting:
   * The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
 - Allows the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
   * original title
   * movie poster image thumbnail
   * A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
   * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
   * release date


## Why this Project?

By building this app, the understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android is demonstrated. The app communicates with the Internet and provides a responsive and delightful user experience.

## Implementations demonstrated in this project

 - App fetches data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
 - App uses adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
 - App incorporates libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write.
